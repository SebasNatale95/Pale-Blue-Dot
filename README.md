**A landing page for a podcast.**

This is a very simple project. It's the landing page of a channel that collects podcasts from other channels, all related to technology, using only HTML and CSS. 

The site has the basic things of today's web such as external libraries (Font Awesome icons and Google Fonts fonts), podcast iframes from Spotify, media queries for a _mobile first_ design (from 320px wide) and another desktop (from 1440px wide), among others.
